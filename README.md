# hello-world
It's my first own repository. Here I would like to manage some code and store funny images.
I hope in future people could share my great code with me through this!

HulaHu, this evening I'm seeting 'fore my window and looking for freedom. Tea has run out and only tiredness left. Nice to recognize the true will to live...
